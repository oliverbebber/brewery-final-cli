## Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to suggest changes to the codebase [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html).

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, make sure to update the documentation.
4. Issue your pull request.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/oliverbebber/brewery-final-cli/issues)

GitHub issues are used to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/oliverbebber/brewery-final-cli/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** usually include:

- A brief summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce the issue
  - Be specific
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you were expecting to happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (why you think is causing the issue and/or things you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
